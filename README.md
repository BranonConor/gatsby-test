# ðŸš€ React / Gatsby playground

## [See the live site](https://coding-comrades-react-playground.netlify.app/)

## Welcome!
This is a playground for Gatbsy, React, styling, and all kinds of Front End Development work. The repo is organized in what I believe to be consistent with many industry best-practices from my own work and experience. Over time, I'll add more and more to it as we do livecoding sessions in our Coding Comrades discord channel. 

More updates coming soon to this README. 

### Cheers!
